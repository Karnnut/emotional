# AI Driving Behavior Detection in VR Driving Game

## Introduction
This project focuses on creating an AI system designed to detect and analyze driving behaviors within a virtual reality (VR) driving game environment. The primary goal of this AI is to assist in assessing a player's ability to navigate complex traffic scenarios, specifically roundabouts and crosswalks. The AI utilizes a combination of fuzzy logic and rule-based techniques to evaluate and score a player's driving performance.

## Features

##### 1.) Behavior Detection
- **Roundabout Navigation:** 
Thishe AI monitors how the player approaches, enters, and exits roundabouts. 
- **Crosswalk Compliance:** 
The AI evaluates the player's behavior when encountering crosswalks, checking for proper stopping, yielding to pedestrians.

##### 2.) Fuzzy Logic
- Fuzzy logic is used to define rules for assessing driving behavior. Fuzzy sets and membership functions are employed to represent vague and imprecise concepts, such as "safe following distance" or "smooth acceleration."

##### 3. Rule-Based System
- **Behavioral Rules:** 
AI combines rule-based systems with pre-defined behavioral rules. These rules cover various aspects of driving, such as speed limits, crashes, speed before entering a roundabout.
